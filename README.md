# RQ6: The current method to simulate synthetic rankings is not tailored to RBO's properties. How can we adapt this simulation taking inspiration from RBO?

Sub-directories are arranged in the following manner:

- `src/`: final source code. Along with the final paper and the poster, my project will deliver an improved version of `src/simulate.R`, extending
upon the existing [version](https://github.com/julian-urbano/sigir2024-rbo/blob/main/src/simulate.R).
- `planning/`: this directory contains planning documents related to my final paper
- `exploratory/`: exploration scripts, this directory mainly contains Jupyter 
Notebook files.
